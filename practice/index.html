        The eye of a bird is larger compared to the size of the animal than for any other group of animals, although much of it is concealed in its skull. The Ostrich has the largest eye of any land vertebrate, with an axial length of 50 mm (2 in), twice that of the human eye.The eye of a bird is larger compared to the size of the animal than for any other group of animals, although much of it is concealed in its skull.
