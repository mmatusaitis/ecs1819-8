The fact that Mallie perservered through this inspired Jackie to do the same and join the majors on a white team.</p>

                <p>Jackie Robinson was the first African American to join the major leagues in baseball since segregation started in 1889. A lot led to that decision. His family was the only black family on thei block, where they received lots of discrimination, but that didn't make them any weaker. He was then the first athlete ever to receive varsity letters in four sports at UCLA, one being baseball. He then had to drop out of college because he could not pay for the expenses, so he joined the army. After 2 years, he had to discharge because of racial discrimination. A little bit later, he was asked to be on the Brooklyn Dodgers, which is what he is most known for.</p>
